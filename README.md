# 341-Restaurant-Ordering-System
A high fidelity prototype of a mobile ordering system for restaurants or cafes.


Usability Criteria:
  
1. Effectiveness: Whether users can complete their goals and tasks with the software system
-       It has to provide restaurant data (all menu items) to allow ‘front of house’ to work easily and more efficiently.
-       It has to provide a visual representation of the ordering stack for ‘back of house’, complete with the ability to remove items once done.
2. Efficiency: Requires the least time/number of steps in order for the users to complete their tasks.
-       It must improve the communication between ‘front of house’ and ‘back of house’ by sending an order though once it has been made.
-       It must be editable, able to edit dish ingredients for allergies etc.
3. Memorability: How easy the system’s steps are to remember once learned. Important goal to include if systems will be used infrequently. 
-       It has to be easy to understand at a glance, use common expressions and use colloquial language wherever possible so new employees have less to learn and make ordering faster due to repetition.
-       If it is not a well-used page then it has to contain a pop up help menu so it is easier to use.
 
User experience goals: 
  
1.	It must provide means of effective communication between the front of house and back of house with all food ordering attributes leaving no ambiguity.
 
2.	It must also provide a well-defined and easy to use interface for the users in order to make ordering as efficient as possible.
